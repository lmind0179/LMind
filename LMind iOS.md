Of course. Here is a user guide for the LMind app, written in English.

## **Welcome to LMind! üí°**

Welcome to **LMind**, your new tool for visual thinking and organization. LMind helps you structure your thoughts, ideas, and projects by creating intuitive mind maps. Turn complex information into a clear, hierarchical map that's easy to understand and navigate.

***

## **Getting Started**

* **Create a New Map**: Tap the **New File** icon in the sidebar or use the `‚åòN` shortcut to start with a blank canvas.
* **Your First Node**: The central box is called a **node**. Tap it once to select it, then tap it again (or press `‚åò + Enter`) to start typing your main topic.

***

## **Basic Controls**

* **Add a Child Node**: Select a node and press the **Tab** key. This creates a new node connected to the first, perfect for adding details or sub-topics.
* **Add a Sibling Node**: Select a node and press the **Enter** key. This creates a new node at the same level, ideal for listing multiple points.
* **Toolbar Controls**: If you're not using a keyboard, you can use the **`+`** (add child) and **`‚Ü©Ô∏é`** (add sibling) buttons in the top toolbar.

***

## **Managing Your Nodes**

* **Selection**: A single tap selects a node. To select multiple nodes, tap the **checkmark (‚úì) icon** in the toolbar to enter multi-select mode, then tap all the nodes you want.
* **Move**: Simply drag and drop a node onto another to make it a child node. This makes reorganizing your ideas incredibly easy.
* **Edit**: Select a node and press `‚åò + Enter` to edit its text. Press `ESC` to finish editing.
* **Line Breaks**: While editing text, press `Shift + Enter` to create a new line within the same node.
* **Delete**: Select one or more nodes and press the **Delete** key or tap the trash icon in the toolbar.
* **Fold & Unfold**: Tap the small circle on the right side of a node to hide or show its child nodes. This helps you focus on different parts of your map.

***

## **Styling & Features**

* **Formatting**: Tap the **paintbrush (üñåÔ∏è) icon** to open the inspector. Here you can change fonts, colors, node shapes, and more for individual nodes or entire levels.
* **Themes**: In the inspector, switch to the **Themes** tab to apply a consistent, professional look to your entire map with a single tap.
* **Document View**: Want to see your map as a structured outline? Tap the **document (üìÑ) icon** in the toolbar to switch to a linear, text-based view.
* **Exporting**: Share your work by tapping the **export (‚Üë) icon**. You can save your mind map as an image, PDF, Markdown file, and more.
