# Privacy Policy for LMind

**Effective Date:** September 3, 2025

## Introduction
Thank you for using LMind. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about the data LMind handles and to assure you that your privacy is respected and protected. Our philosophy is simple: your data is yours, and we do not collect it.

## Information We Do Not Collect
LMind is designed to be a private and secure space for your thoughts and ideas. We do **not** collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal information. This includes, but is not limited to:
* Your name, email address, or other contact information.
* Usage analytics, crash reports, or telemetry data.
* Any content you create within the application, such as the text in your mind map nodes or memos.

## Data Storage
All data you create in LMind, including your mind map files (`.lmind`), custom themes (`.lmindthemes`), and application settings, is stored exclusively in two locations:

1.  **On Your Local Device:** Data is stored securely on your Mac's hard drive.
2.  **In Your Personal iCloud Account:** If you have iCloud enabled, the application uses Apple's official iCloud services to sync your files across your devices. All data is stored within your private iCloud container, which we do not have access to. The security and privacy of your iCloud data are governed by Apple's privacy policies.

## Third-Party Services
LMind does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app includes third-party libraries (`DocX-Swift`, `ZIPFoundation`) for the sole purpose of providing file export functionality (e.g., creating `.docx` files). These libraries operate entirely offline on your device and do not transmit any data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future if the app's functionality changes. Any updates will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
